### 1. Which variables/coefficients provided a non-random amount of variance to the mpg values in the dataset?
####_Values in the columns vehicle-length and ground-clearance provide non-random amounts of variance to the mpg values in the dataset.

### 2. Is the slope of the linear model considered to be zero? Why or why not?
No, the slope of the linear model is not considered to be 0.  There is a significant linear relationship between mpg and vehicle_length/ground_clearance.

### 3. Does this linear model predict mpg of MechaCar prototypes effectively? Why or why not?
Yes, this model predicts the mpg effectively.  The multiple r-squared value is 0.72 (strong>=0.7) and the p-value is low, leading us to fail to reject the null hypothesis.
